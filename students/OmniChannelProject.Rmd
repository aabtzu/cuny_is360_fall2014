#To measure the ROI of an omnichannel intitiative, each store groups or district will assess the
#usage of the new tools deployed to the field and ecommerce associates. The goal is to increase
#sales by giving the customer a seamless shopping experience along multiple channels. The table #below is a compilation of KPI's from City Stores Group 1 from Fiscal Year 2013.

```{r set-up}
require (markdown)
```

#Pilot analysis will be done with City Stores Group 1.


# From this table, there are two variables we are more interested in. We'd like to know the 
#mean and the median average of Sales, and correlate Sales with the omnisales dollars.
